# MySnake
This is my first stand-alone project with any programming language. It's a simple snake game. I took inspiration for it from two 
tutorials, which are listed below. However, the code for the game is mainly my own, as can be seen if compared with that from 
the tutorials.

- from this one I got the idea of how to move the snake - popping the last piece and unshifting a new head in front of the snake.

- this one helped me fix a bug I had when the snake was eating. It was caused by the overcomplicated method I used to grow my snake. 
More on this can be seen in the comments in my code.

Enjoy!
